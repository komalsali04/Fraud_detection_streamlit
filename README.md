 ```
📥File upload format

Make sure your uploaded CSV file matches the input format expected by the model. You can test with the included:

sample_input.csv



🎯 Model Details
- Trained using Logistic Regression on a balanced subset (492 fraud & 492 normal)

- Preprocessing includes feature scaling and class balancing

- .pkl model loaded at runtime for prediction



💡 Future Improvements
- Add SHAP-based explanations for predictions

- Allow raw dataset uploads and apply preprocessing on-the-fly

- Host as a Flask app with authentication
